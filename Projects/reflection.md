# Reflection Unit 1 
### Reflection for Project 1 

### 1. What challenges did I face? 
One of the main challenges that I faced was during the programming phase of the project. I am a beginner to python and coding as a whole therefore, I knew that 
creating a functional calculator with hidden features would be a little more challenging for me. However, initially I tried to challange myself even more through creating 
a calculator that would take in multiple integer inputs, along with the operations in one line. Furthermore, I was planning for the calculator to integrate BODMAS operations. 
As I began my programming creating a calculator with BODMAS proved to be harder than what I had anticipated. Consequently, I had to reroute and take a different approach that would
be more feasible in the time frame. For this reason, I changed the structure of my calculator to first take in the operation input. I still wanted the element of being able to 
input multiple integers therefore, I created a program that would take in the integer values seperated by commas and then process them. I found this approached worked better than 
my previous one where I was converting the input into a list and then processing the integers however, this would not allow for integers that were more than one digit. 

Another challange that I faced during the development of my product was the
