## Criteria A: Planning 

### Problem Defenition 

My client, is one of the top colleges in the country. In their school management system they have individual unique passwords for both staff and students. The unique password is set by the use themselves and is used for a variety of purposes including submitting assignments, checking grades, assigning assignments, staff accessing and storing test files and answers etc. Recently there have been various problems because of the system, this includes: the lack of password strength, staff of the older generation forgetting their passwords, etc. This has lead to issues such as the leakage of test papers, changed scoring, acessing multiple accounts at the same time and more. For this reason the head has reached out to us to create an user friendly password manager system for the staff that is hidden from the public eye. A calculator would be the most appropriate way to do this as the application is aldready instaled within the personal devices of most staff and it is popular to use. This ensures that safeguarding of sensitive information in the individual accounts and helps preserve the integrity of the school overall.  

#### Sucess Criteria 

1. The calculator should accept user iinput to perform basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division)
2. The calculator can handle simple errors (e.g ., division by zero) and give appropriate feedback
3. if the secret code is given ("open123"), the program will change models and act as a password manager
4. In the password manager mode, the use should be able to perform CRUD operations (Create, Replace, Update, Delete)
   Add a password (for example, for a website).
   View the stored passwords (only if they re-enter the secret code).
5. Save passwords permanently and securely
6. Use the terminal to interact with the user.
