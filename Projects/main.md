### Problem Defenition 

My client, is one of the top colleges in the country. In their school management system they have individual unique passwords for both staff and students. The unique password is set by the use themselves and is used for a variety of purposes including submitting assignments, checking grades, assigning assignments, staff accessing and storing test files and answers etc. Recently there have been various problems because of the system, this includes: the lack of password strength, staff of the older generation forgetting their passwords, etc. This has lead to issues such as the leakage of test papers, changed scoring, acessing multiple accounts at the same time and more. Recent evenets regarding the school is deeply affecting the public image of the university and the client is looking for the most efficient method to prevent the issue. 

#### Sucess Criteria 

1. The calculator should accept user input to perform basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division)
2. Calculator should be able to perform multiple operations at the same time following order of operations (BODMAS)
3. The calculator can handle simple errors (e.g ., division by zero) and give appropriate feedback
4. When the masterkey is entered the calculator will act as a password manager. The masterkey is unique for each of the staff and can only be altered with a special code available only to the headmaster (code yet to be decided) 
5. In the password manager mode, the use should be able to perform CRUD operations (Create, Replace, Update, Delete)
   Add a password (for example, for a website).
   View the stored passwords (only if they re-enter the secret code).
6. Staff should be able to view and acess stored password efficiently
7. Users should be able to save password safely and securly in an encrypted csv file 
8. For effciency purposes the terminal will be used to interact with users

#### Proposed solution 

Taking into account the different aspects of this solution we have proposed an user friendly password manager system for the staff that is hidden from the public eye. A calculator would be the most appropriate way to do this as the application is aldready instaled within the personal devices of most staff and it is popular to use. This ensures that safeguarding of sensitive information in the individual accounts and helps preserve the integrity of the school overall.
